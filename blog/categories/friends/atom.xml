    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been two amazing weeks now since we launched.</p>

<p>During this time we had some really exciting experiences with our app.
We want to share them with you, to show you how Socialeyes can affect your daily
social life.</p>

<p>If you had some great experiences as well please let us know.

</p>


<p>Last week I got out of a meeting. I was really hungry and in a rush. I just wanted to grab
some food and not make a great deal of it. Anyway I posted an eating mood because it
can be done so quickly. Within 3 minutes a friend texted me about grabbing a bite
together and we met casually.</p>

<p>Even though Socialeyes has given me lots of opportunities like this, I was impressed
how fast I found a friend to join me. Instead of grabbing a quick sandwich on my own I
had the chance to see a friend, even though I had missed to meet him for a long time.</p>

</p>


<p>Last week my cousin who lives in a different city was in town for a short visit. It
happened that he was close to me. Both of us were in an area we don&rsquo;t visit frequently.</p>

<p>He saw my last post and asked me to meet for a coffee. Later he told me, that he didn&rsquo;t
ask me before traveling because he had a tight schedule for the visit and thought it was
impossible to meet. Somehow reacting to my mood post felt more relaxed to him and
gave him the freedom to see me without worrying about his duties.</p>

<p>Even though we had grown up together the urge to schedule life almost made me miss
to share my experiences within launching week with him in person. It was exciting for
both of us to feel the beauty of this spontaneous encounter.</p>

</p>


<p>During our launch week we were really busy and it felt like it was impossible to see any
humans apart from our team. I posted an activity (it was not even about food) just to test
a feature and it was close to lunchtime. A friend of mine, who is part of the community,
happened to be working nearby and received a notification. He messaged me that he
was going out for lunch and that I could join him.</p>

<p>I realized that his workplace was so close and wondered how often we missed the
chance to eat together.</p>

</p>


<p>A month ago I wandered around İstiklal Avenue to find a good place for a midnight
snack.</p>

<p>I ran into a guy from my University. We knew each other since some days only, but after
some chit chat I Invited him to have breakfast at my rooftop the next day with some friends.
A bit later he invited me to watch a Movie with some of his friends. I was
surprised that friends of mine which he had met at the rooftop joined the activity without
me inviting them. At the end of our Launch day I felt still energized but in need to relax.
Fortunately this friend posted about another movie night on Socialeyes.</p>

<p>This was the first activity I joined after our release. I am looking forward to experience
more of these spontaneous activities, now that our community is growing rapidly.</p>

</p>


<p>When we launched Socialeyes I came home one day and felt the need to relax a bit
while playing some console games.</p>

<p>Usually I prefer to play those games with company, this time I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;
Wondering if I can invite one of my friends via Socialeyes, I
posted a mood with the comment &ldquo;anyone wants to join me for a quick game&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Fortunately one of my friends who also had a long day was in my area at this time. He
was tired as well but liked the idea of having just a quick competition with me before
ending the day. </p>

<p>Later he told me that reacting to my mood post somehow it remembered of the time we
had during our childhood. Those days when you felt free to just visited friends without
appointment and asked if they can come out and play.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week was special for many people and hopefully  for you as well. Not because you got excited of  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/02/tinder-plus-the-paid-version-featuring-an-undo-button-and-more-arrives-in-u-s-next-month/"><b>news about “Tinder Plus.</b>”</a>
This other moment, when you thought &ldquo;Wow, I didn&rsquo;t expect that to happen. It should happen way more often!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are more of this moments than we tend to realize.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/carry-a-surprise-journal-to-find-areas-for-self-impro-1638467349"><b>Sometimes it just needs a little reminder.</b></a></p>

<p>Somehow you found your way to this blog. Maybe on purpose or maybe by accident. No matter how, it seems like you are as passionate about people, socializing and technology as we are.</p>

<p>Technology has become a great tool for those, who love people. There are many new ways for those who are passionate about getting in touch with new spirits. Anyway it is <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236752"><b>hard to substitute the energy you feel when you get in touch with people.</b></a></p>

<p>Sometimes the way we are using technology is drifting away from the original purpose. Everyone knows the point when you start realizing that some of your routines shifted from supporting real life encounters to using technology for its own sake.</p>

<p>Instead of enjoying the thrill of possible rejection, we use technology to find a match before meeting.</p>

<p>Instead of planing a trip, we use technology to find the quickest route.</p>

<p>Instead of looking forward to meetings, we use technology to optimize our schedule.</p>

<p>The most beautiful moments of socializing don’t happen on purpose.</p>

<p>It’s this moment when you’ve been heavily procrastinating to call an old friend and just stumble into him at the small café you haven&rsquo;t been to for a year.</p>

<p>It’s this moment when you meet a business partner at a concert and discover that both of you fell in love with the same punk band twenty years ago.</p>

<p>It’s this moment when you start talking to a stranger in a hostel and end up spending a whole weekend together discovering a new city.</p>

<p>Those are the moments when you start realizing that it’s not always about optimizing your day. Often it&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/charlie_todd_the_shared_experience_of_absurdity"><b>spontaneous encounters that bring  more value to your life.</b></a></p>

<p>Now ask yourself two questions: &ldquo;Was there a moment this week, I hope to remember in the future? Did this moment happen exactly the way I pictured it last week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to put the spotlight on people again and let technology help you encounter more of those spontaneous moments. Reflect about this topic on your preferred channel with the hashtag #liveisspontan (no feeds yet, can be our thing) and get in touch with us to create more of this moments together.</p>

It is summer time. We spend our days on the beach getting sun tan, enjoying our Mojitos and swimming. During this summer relaxation, we take out our phones to take a selfie or text to our friends and we see the inevitable result on the top bar in our screens. The battery is running low! We all enjoy our apps and they will surely use some portion of our batteries. Looking for a charger could be painful on the beach. We all feel the need to play a game, take a look at our friends on Facebook, or simply listen to music while we enjoy ourselves on the beach. So how to tackle the battery problem? Here are a couple of simple tricks you can do to avoid the battery problems.

###1. Turn your location services off: 
Location is an important input for most of the apps (including Socialeyes). However it also takes away from our batteries. There are times when you think you might need them but also there are other times when you can turn it off and turn it on again only when it is necessary. Summer time could be one of the times when you can turn it off. Go to privacy settings and choose location services and switch the main button at the top off. But do not forget to switch it back on again later because most of
the apps will be useless or will not function properly without your location.

###3. Turn your brightness lower:
 Go to “Brightness” section and turn your screen brightness to a lower level at which you can still see your screen but consume less energy. On sunny days this could be difficult given the fact that it will already be a bit more challenging to see what is going on your screen while the sun is shining.

###5. Always charge your phone over the night to 100%:
 This is one of the most crucial steps. You might have drunken a bit too much that night and you could barely brush your teeth or find your pj’s. But find that charger of yours and let it charge while you sleep! One think to pay attention to is that try to charge it at the farthest place to your body. Scientists believe that sleeping in the same room as you charge your phone could not be good for your health due to the magnetic waves it produces.
